# Chest-CT-Segmentation-and-Model-Comparative-Analysis

### ABSTRACT
Our objective for this project is to perform lung CT image segmentation using the following architectures: U-Net, U-Net++, and V-Net, and compare the three models to find which model provides more precise region segmentation with the highest score and the lowest loss. We performed a multi-class segmentation since the dataset contains the following three classes: lung mask, heart mask, and trachea mask. The model with the highest performance metrics and the lowest loss score was the U-Net++ model. These discoveries play a crucial role in the progression of medical imaging, particularly in improving the precision of diagnosing lung diseases.

### BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW
Lung disorders are the third prominent cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis of lung infections/diseases through AI-enabled advanced clinical diagnosis systems could save people before any severe damage to the lungs. Segmentation is an important step in the overall process. In this paper, we aim to add knowledge to this area by creating lung image CT segmentation models using U-net, U-net++, and V-net architectures. To train our models, we use a dataset of 16708 images. Ideally, we want to use this model for accurate segmentation of lung CT scans to help physicians diagnose patients more efficiently. In the literature, Skourt et al demonstrated lung segmentation using U-net[1]. They were able to achieve an accurate segmentation with a 0.95 Dice-Coefficient index based on a small image set that contains a few hundred of manually segmented lung images. Murugappan et al developed a computationally efficient and robust deep learning model for lung segmentation using CT images with DeepLabV3 + networks for two-class (background and lung field) and four-class (ground-glass opacities, background, consolidation, and lung field) using a publicly available database for COVID-19 that contains 750 chest CT images[2]. The researchers proposed an improved DeepLabV3+ network with ResNet-18 which requires fewer network parameters and achieved higher accuracy in semantic segmentation compared to the original DeepLabV3+ network. In another paper published in 2021 which also focused on image segmentation of COVID-19 lung images, Saood and Hatem attempted to detect and label infected tissues on CT lung images USING SegNet (which is a scene segmentation tool) and U-net[3]. They found that U-net performed better than SegNet as a multi-class segment with a 0.91 mean accuracy.

### DATASET
The dataset is adapted from the Lung Segmentation dataset by KÃ³nya et al., 2020[4]. It contains chest CT scan images and their corresponding segmentations - lungs, heart, and trachea. Since there are 3 classes - lung mask, heart mask, and trachea mask, it is a multi-class segmentation.
Each tensor has the following shape: number of slices, width, height, and number of classes, where the width and height number of slices are individual parameters of each tensor ID, and the number of classes = 3. The dataset has images in RGB format and masks in RGB format along with train csv which contains image names.
The scans are converted to images of each slice and there are a total of 16,708 images and their masks. Sample image representation:
The dataset can be downloaded in .zip format and the size can be accommodated over Google Drive which can be then linked to Google Colab where we will be running our model and tests. In terms of pre-processing, the images were resized to 256,256,3 which is suitable for traditional CNN models.
